What's Caesar cipher?
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some 
fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by 
A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
